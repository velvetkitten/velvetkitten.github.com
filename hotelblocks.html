Washington, DC is a great city - but it's also a big city. The weekend of the wedding there is apparently a convention in town, so rooms are booking up fast. 

If you're traveling to DC to join us, first - thank you. We really appreciate your time and are thrilled to celebrate with you.


Second, we have room blocks at 3 hotels which are offering good rates:

Hotel Blocks: All rooms must be booked before April 17th.

The Willard Intercontinental 


Crown Plaza Hamilton

Hilton Garden Inn



However, you might be able to find cheaper rates online. And if you're looking for something at a lower price point, Hotwire is probably your best option. If you are considering going through Hotwire, Ross and I would be happy to help suggest which description sounds like a good option.
