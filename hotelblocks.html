Washington, DC is a great city, but it's not cheap. The weekend of the wedding there is apparently a convention in town, so rooms are booking up fast. 
<p></p>
<p>If you're traveling to DC to join us, first - thank you. We really appreciate your time and are thrilled to celebrate with you.</p>


<p>Second, we have room blocks at 3 hotels which are offering good rates</p>

Hotel Blocks: All rooms must be booked before April 17th.

<h3> Other Options</h3>

If these don't interest you, there are hundreds of options in the DC area by all the major hotel providers. If you want to stay in VA or MD, the wedding is Metro convenient (at least by NYC standards.) 

And if you're looking for something at a much lower price point, <a href="http://www.hotwire.com">Hotwire</a> is probably your best option. If you are considering going through Hotwire, Ross and I would be happy to help suggest which description sounds like a good option.
